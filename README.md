# Community Zeth Protocol Improvements Proposals (Community ZPIPs)

A Community Zeth Protocol Improvement Proposal (Community ZPIP) is a markdown document suggesting improvements and changes to the Zeth protocol. The ZPIP process serves as a semi-formal communication framework allowing to discuss potential changes in the Zeth protocol (instead of doing so directly via "unstructured" tickets on the [implementation](https://github.com/clearmatics/zeth) repository or directly on the [specifications](https://github.com/clearmatics/zeth-specifications) repository).

All ZPIPs must follow the process below in order to be added to this repository (this process is heavily based on [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/)).

:rotating_light: **WARNING:** Finalized ZPIPs merged to this repository will **only** be so for their technical accuracy.
As such, merging a ZPIP **does not** mean that the ZPIP will become part of the Zeth protocol development roadmap and be implemented.

## Guidelines

Please read the [ZPIP-1](./proposals/zpip-1.md) for further details about the process.
