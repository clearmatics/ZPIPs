# ZPIPs assets directory

Images, diagrams and auxiliary files related to a ZPIP must be included in a folder of this directory.

**Example:** `assets/zpip-N` (where `N` is to be replaced with the ZPIP number).
Linking to images in the ZPIP must be done via relative links such as `../assets/zpip-1/image.png` for instance.
